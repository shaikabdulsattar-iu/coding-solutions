# Largest Number At Least Twice of Others

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

You are given an integer array `nums` where the largest integer is  **unique**.

Determine whether the largest element in the array is  **at least twice**  as much as every other number in the array. If it is, return  *the  **index**  of the largest element, or return* `-1` *otherwise*.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: nums = [3,6,1,0]
Output: 1
Explanation: 6 is the largest integer.
For every other number in the array x, 6 is at least twice as big as x.
The index of value 6 is 1, so we return 1.

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: -1
Explanation: 4 is less than twice the value of 3, so we return -1.

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 2 <= nums.length <= 50
- 0 <= nums[i] <= 100
- The largest element in nums is unique.

        nums.remove(l)
        for i in nums:
            if i*2 > l:
                return -1
        return idx
