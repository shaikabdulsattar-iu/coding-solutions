# Self Dividing Numbers

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

A  **self-dividing number**  is a number that is divisible by every digit it contains.

- For example, 128 is a self-dividing number because 128 % 1 == 0, 128 % 2 == 0, and 128 % 8 == 0.

A  **self-dividing number**  is not allowed to contain the digit zero.

Given two integers `left` and `right`, return  *a list of all the  **self-dividing numbers**  in the range*  `[left, right]` (both  **inclusive**).

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: left = 1, right = 22
Output: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,11,12,15,22]

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: left = 47, right = 85
Output: [48,55,66,77]

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 1 <= left <= right <= 104

class Solution:
    def selfDividingNumbers(self, left: int, right: int) -> List[int]:
        res = []

        for i in range(left, right + 1):
            n = i

            while n != 0:
                divisor = n % 10

                if divisor == 0 or i % divisor != 0:
                    break

                n //= 10

            if n == 0:
                res.append(i)
                
        return res
        
```
