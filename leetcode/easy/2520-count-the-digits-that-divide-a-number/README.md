# Count the Digits That Divide a Number

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given an integer `num`, return  *the number of digits in `num` that divide* `num`.

An integer `val` divides `nums` if `nums % val == 0`.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: num = 7
Output: 1
Explanation: 7 divides itself, hence the answer is 1.

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: num = 121
Output: 2
Explanation: 121 is divisible by 1, but not 2. Since 1 occurs twice as a digit, we return 2.

```

 **Example 3:** 

```
Input: num = 1248
Output: 4
Explanation: 1248 is divisible by all of its digits, hence the answer is 4.

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 1 <= num <= 109
- num does not contain 0 as one of its digits.

        temp = num
        
        while temp > 0:
            digit = temp % 10
            if num % digit == 0:
                count += 1
            temp //= 10
            
        return count
             


        
        
```
