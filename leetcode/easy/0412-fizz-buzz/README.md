![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given an integer `n`, return  *a string array* `answer` *(**1-indexed**) where* :

- answer[i] == "FizzBuzz" if i is divisible by 3 and 5.
- answer[i] == "Fizz" if i is divisible by 3.
- answer[i] == "Buzz" if i is divisible by 5.
- answer[i] == i (as a string) if none of the above conditions are true.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: n = 3
Output: ["1","2","Fizz"]

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: n = 5
Output: ["1","2","Fizz","4","Buzz"]

```

 **Example 3:** 

```
Input: n = 15
Output: ["1","2","Fizz","4","Buzz","Fizz","7","8","Fizz","Buzz","11","Fizz","13","14","FizzBuzz"]

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 1 <= n <= 104

                l.append("Buzz")
            else:
