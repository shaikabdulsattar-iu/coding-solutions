# Gray Code

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

An  **n-bit gray code sequence**  is a sequence of `2n` integers where:

- Every integer is in the inclusive range [0, 2n - 1],
- The first integer is 0,
- An integer appears no more than once in the sequence,
- The binary representation of every pair of adjacent integers differs by exactly one bit, and
- The binary representation of the first and last integers differs by exactly one bit.

Given an integer `n`, return  *any valid  **n-bit gray code sequence***.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: n = 2
Output: [0,1,3,2]
Explanation:
The binary representation of [0,1,3,2] is [00,01,11,10].
- 00 and 01 differ by one bit
- 01 and 11 differ by one bit
- 11 and 10 differ by one bit
- 10 and 00 differ by one bit
[0,2,3,1] is also a valid gray code sequence, whose binary representation is [00,10,11,01].
- 00 and 10 differ by one bit
- 10 and 11 differ by one bit
- 11 and 01 differ by one bit
- 01 and 00 differ by one bit

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: n = 1
Output: [0,1]

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 1 <= n <= 16

        size = 1 << n  # 2^n
class Solution:
    def grayCode(self, n: int) -> List[int]:
        size = 1 << n  # 2^n
        return [i ^ (i >> 1) for i in range(size)] 
```
